# Exploring Weather Data: A Comprehensive Analysis

## Introduction

Weather data analysis plays a crucial role in understanding climate patterns and their impact on various aspects of our lives. In this project, we delve into historical weather data to derive insights and understand the underlying trends.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset used in this analysis, named `weatherHistory.csv`, contains a rich array of weather-related attributes:

- `Formatted Date`
- `Summary`
- `Precip Type`
- `Temperature (C)`
- `Apparent Temperature (C)`
- `Humidity`
- `Wind Speed (km/h)`
- `Wind Bearing (degrees)`
- `Visibility (km)`
- `Loud Cover`
- `Pressure (millibars)`
- `Daily Summary`

## Data Preprocessing

The initial phase involves preparing the data for analysis. Techniques applied include:

- Handling missing values
- Converting date columns to datetime format
- Extracting date components
- Normalizing numerical columns for improved analysis

## Insights and Analysis

### Summary Statistics

A comprehensive overview of the dataset, showcasing statistics across various attributes, providing a snapshot of the data's distribution and central tendencies.

### Correlation Analysis

Exploring relationships between different weather parameters using correlation matrices, identifying potential associations and dependencies.

### Visualizations
