# Weather Data Analysis

## Medium Document

For a detailed analysis and insights derived from the dataset, please refer to the Medium article:
[Exploring Weather Data](https://medium.com/@sai2804aniruth/exploring-weather-data-a-comprehensive-analysis-b6482ce2a16e)

## Overveiw

This repository contains a Python script (`index.py`) and a dataset (`weatherHistory.csv`) for analyzing historical weather data. The script preprocesses the data and derives various insights to understand different aspects of the weather patterns recorded.

## Dataset

The dataset (`weatherHistory.csv`) comprises the following attributes:

- `Formatted Date`: Date and time of the recorded weather data.
- `Summary`: A brief summary of the weather conditions.
- `Precip Type`: Type of precipitation (rain, snow, etc.).
- `Temperature (C)`: Temperature in Celsius.
- `Apparent Temperature (C)`: Perceived temperature in Celsius.
- `Humidity`: Humidity level.
- `Wind Speed (km/h)`: Speed of the wind in kilometers per hour.
- `Wind Bearing (degrees)`: Wind direction in degrees.
- `Visibility (km)`: Visibility in kilometers.
- `Loud Cover`: Indicates the presence of loud weather cover.
- `Pressure (millibars)`: Atmospheric pressure in millibars.
- `Daily Summary`: A summary of the weather condition for the day.

## Usage

### Dependencies

Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy

You can install the dependencies via pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy
```

### Running the Script

1. Place the dataset file (`weatherHistory.csv`) in the same directory as `index.py`.
2. Run the `index.py` script using Python:

```bash
python index.py
```

The script performs the following actions:
- Handles missing values, converts date columns to datetime format, and extracts date components.
- Normalizes numerical columns for better analysis.
- Derives insights from the data, such as summary statistics, correlations, and visualizations.
- Displays these insights in the console.

### File Structure

```
- index.py: Python script for data preprocessing and analysis.
- weatherHistory.csv: Dataset containing weather history information.
- README.md: Documentation for the repository.
```

## Additional Notes

- The insights derived from the dataset are aimed at providing a comprehensive understanding of various weather parameters and their relationships.
- Customizations or additional analysis can be added to the script based on specific research or analysis requirements.
